# How to contribute to awesome-oss

## Which programs are for this list?

Open source projects with links to contribute or donate. Make sure you can access the source-code of the project you want to contribute. A lot of websites, guides and YouTube-videos confuse freeware or closely related licenses with open source. 

If you are still not sure you can check the definition for open source by the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/osd).
